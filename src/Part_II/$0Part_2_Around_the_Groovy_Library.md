# Part 2. Around the Groovy library

#### Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking of them.

<b>Alfred North Whitehead</b>

Part 1 has lifted you to the level where you can confidently work with the Groovy language. You’ve also seen a glimpse
of some of the fundamental parts of the Groovy library. Part 2 builds upon this knowledge, diving into other pieces of
the Groovy library and exploring how Groovy extends the Java Runtime Environment. You’ve already seen how Groovy tries
to make commonly performed tasks as easy as possible in the language—this part of the book shows how the same principle
is applied in Groovy’s libraries, using many of the advanced language features available to let you do more work with
less code.

Chapter 11 introduces the builder concept, which is one of Groovy’s distinctive capabilities, because it can only be 
implemented in a general library class with a truly dynamic language. We’ll examine the builders that come as part of 
the Groovy distribution and show you how to implement your own builders.

Chapter 12 covers, at the object/method level, pure GDK library capabilities that weren’t presented in part 1, because 
they aren’t directly related to language features.

Chapter 13 goes through Groovy’s library support for dealing with relational and other database systems, providing 
total flexibility where necessary and significant shortcuts where simple solutions suffice.

Chapter 14 dives into the special topic of XML and JSON support in Groovy: reading and writing documents with ultimate 
performance, transforming them into other representations, and using XML or JSON for interoperation between 
heterogeneous systems.

Chapter 15 guides you through the world of web services and how to use the Groovy library and language features to 
take advantage of this cornucopia of information.

Chapter 16 shows how to seamlessly integrate Groovy with Java projects and other JVM languages.

Part 3 will lead you to new places where Groovy is applied for testing, concurrent programming, DSLs, and the whole 
ecosystem around it.
